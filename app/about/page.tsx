            <p>
              I am a father of a child with Type 1 diabetes and I'm always searching for inspiring stories to share with
              my son. I want him to know that his diabetes doesn't have to limit his dreams or what he can achieve in
              life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recently, I stumbled across a Reddit post asking about the best diabetic athletes, and I was amazed by how
              many incredible athletes have succeeded at the highest levels of sports while managing Type 1 diabetes. I
              realized these stories needed to be shared more widely.
            </p>

            <p>
              That's why I created Diabetic Athletics - to collect and showcase these inspiring stories in one place. My
              goal is simple: to inspire and motivate people with Type 1 diabetes, especially children and young adults
              who are figuring out their path in life with this condition.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Through this website, I hope to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Show newly diagnosed individuals and their families that diabetes doesn't have to limit their dreams
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide real-world examples of successful athletes who manage their diabetes while competing at elite
                levels
              </li>
              <li>Create awareness about what's possible with proper diabetes management</li>
              <li>
                Build a resource that parents, educators, and healthcare providers can share with young people who have
                Type 1 diabetes
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Growing Collection</h2>
            <p>
              What started as a simple idea inspired by a Reddit post has grown into this collection of profiles
              featuring amateur and professional athletes across many different sports. Each of these individuals
              demonstrates that with proper management, determination, and support, Type 1 diabetes doesn't have to be a
              barrier to athletic achievement.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a parent of a child with diabetes, I know how important it is to have positive role models. I hope
              these stories provide inspiration and practical insights for others on their diabetes journey.
